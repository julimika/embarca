<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Sobre


There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Iniciando o projeto

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Pré-requisitos

* python
* playwright
* pytest
      
### Instalação e configuração

_Nesse passo a passo iremos realizar as instalações necessárias e configuração do ambiente virtual._

1. Clone o repositório:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/julimika/embarca.git
    ```

2. Vá até a pasta do projeto

   ```sh
   cd /caminho/até/o/projeto
    ```
  
3. Já dentro do projeto, crie um ambiente virtual e inicialize-o:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

   ```
4. Instale o playwright:
   ```sh
   pip install pytest-playwright
   playwright install
   ```
5. Para executar os testes:
   ```sh
   pytest tests/test_login,py
   *o exemplo acima é para executar os testes de login. Caso escolha outra, é só mudar o arquivo .py de teste
   ```
